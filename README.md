Portfolio Website

A portfolio website built using:
- Python/Django
- PostgreSQL
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

Most of the layout is by Start Bootstrap's template(https://startbootstrap.com/theme/personal). The project's resume, projects, and contact sections are handled primarily through Django, PostgreSQL and Javascript.

The project startup follows the usual Django usage. From within the app directory with the manage.py file using the terminal, run the following command: (windows) 'py manage.py runserver', (mac/linux) 'python manage.py runserver'. If that doesn't work, try 'python3' at the start.
